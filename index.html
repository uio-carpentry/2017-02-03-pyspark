  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>
  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools,
  including program design, version control, data management,
  and task automation.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

  AUDIENCE

  Explain who your audience is.  (In particular, tell readers if the

<p id="who">
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is aimed at graduate students and other researchers.
  This one-day 
  <a href="http://www.uio.no/english/for-employees/support/research/research-data/training/carpentry/">Carpentry@UiO</a> 
  hands-on workshop will give a short introduction to big data analysis using <strong>pyspark</strong>.
  The Spark Python API (PySpark) exposes the Spark programming model to Python. <a hred="http://spark.apache.org/">Apache® Spark™</a> 
  is an open source and is one of the most popular Big Data frameworks for scaling up your tasks in a cluster. It was developed to utilize 
  distributed, in-memory data structures to improve data processing speeds.
   
  <strong>A basic knowledge of python is recommended but you don't need to have any previous knowledge of big data analysis or Apache Spark.</strong>

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run

<p>
  To participate in a Software Carpentry workshop, you will need
  access to the software described below. In addition, you will
  need an up-to-date web browser.

  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
    research computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
    well.  Installing all of its research packages individually can be
    a bit difficult, so we recommend
    <a href="https://www.continuum.io/anaconda">Anaconda</a>,
    an all-in-one installer.
  </p>

    <p>
      Regardless of how you choose to install it,
      <strong>please make sure you install Python version 3.x</strong>
      (e.g., 3.4 is fine).
    </p>

    <p>
      We will teach Python using the IPython notebook, a programming environment
      that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably
      up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and
      Firefox browsers are all
      <a href="http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/install/install.html#browser-compatibility">supported</a>
      (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9
      and below, are not).

    Some instructors prefer to have learners use a virtual machine (VM)
    rather than install software on their own computers.  If your

  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.

      Load the VM into VirtualBox by selecting "Import Appliance" and
      loading the <code>.ova</code> file.
